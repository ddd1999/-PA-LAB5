This is an application that can manage a catalog of documents.
In the catalog, documents can be added. Documents have an ID which can be used to find them in the catalog.
Each document has a unique ID, a name and may have additional tags, which are pairs name-value. 

The "save" method saves the catalog to an external file, using object serialization.
The "load" method loads the catalog from an external file.
The "view" method opens a document using the native operating system application.
